# Live-Weather-App
WeatherNow is a simple and interactive web application that provides real-time weather updates for any location. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it fetches weather data from an API and displays key details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Features:
🌍 Search weather by city name
⛅ Real-time temperature, humidity, and wind speed updates
📍 Auto-detect location for instant weather updates
🎨 Responsive and user-friendly UI for all devices
☁️ Dynamic weather icons based on conditions

This project helps in understanding API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), and UI/UX design while creating a functional and visually appealing web app. 🚀
